# Stick&Slip

This is a repository for the prototype Stick&Slip device created by Alex Mazursky, Jacob Serfaty, and Pedro Lopes at the University of Chicago's [Human Computer Integration Lab](https://lab.plopes.org/). Stick&Slip is a wearable approach to alter the friction of everyday objects using liquid coatings on the fingerpad!


## Repository Structure

* `Arduino` contains code for the microcontroller (ESP32).
* `PCB` contains the KICAD files for our custom PCB.
* `3D-prints` contains models for the wearable droplet generator and bracelet (.stl files). These can be printed with most SLA printers.
